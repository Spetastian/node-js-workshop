# Introduction to modern JavaScript
JavaScript has shapen up and taken a somewhat different form the last couple of years.

# ES2015 (ES6) and forward
EcmaScript 6 brought some new and nice fatures both to the syntax and the APIs of JavaScript.

Together with NodeJs this has opened up the door for a more progressive approach to adding new features to the language.
