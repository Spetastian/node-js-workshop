# Introduction to modern JavaScript
JavaScript has shapen up and taken a somewhat different form the last couple of years.

The reason this is important for NodeJs is because wou will use the latest EcmaScript features in Node since it has very good support for it.

# ES2015 (ES6) and forward
EcmaScript 6 brought some new and nice fatures both to the syntax and the APIs of JavaScript.

Together with NodeJs this has opened up the door for a more progressive approach to adding new features to the language.
