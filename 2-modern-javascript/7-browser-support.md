Tip: Pick one feature that the target browsers of your project support and start using it right now!

IE11 and forward has support for `let` and `const`.

If you dont care about IE, then start using `let`, `const`, `descructuring` and arrow functions right now!

When you feel comfortable with this small set of features, pick another one and start using it!
