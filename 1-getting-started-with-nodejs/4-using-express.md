# 3. Using express.js
> Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.

Express gives you a nice wrapper around the Node HTTP server and let you easily configure stuff like routing, authentication, file uploads, response types etc. via the help of so called "middlewares".

Express is a good starting point for learning how to build web applications and services with Node and JavaScript. Its easy to wrap your head around and it uses concepts that is reccuring in other web frameworks as well.

## Running the example
Here we have defined a npm script to run this example:

`npm run 1step4`

Then go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Workshop
Express introduces some concepts that are good to know when working with web appliation frameworks in NodeJs.

Try looking up and answering the following questions:

- What are middlewares in Express?
- How do you serve static files?
- What is routing and how does that work in Express?
- What is pug and how is it related to Express?
- What is bodyParser and what does it do?
- How does error handling work in Express?

 The answer to all those questions can be found somewhere on Express homepage: https://expressjs.com/
